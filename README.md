# xmrig-termux-script

A simple bash script to build, configure miner environment in termux using official [xmrig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig)


## Installation

Install termux application from [here]()  




Open termux and paste following command to Install, configure and run miner with a single command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ni3mumbaikar/xmrig-termux-script.git && cd xmrig-termux-script && chmod +x xmrig-install.sh && ./xmrig-install.sh
```


## Important

‚ö†Ô∏è Note : Use this for testing purpose only as this directly mines for my personal monero wallet address with a predefined pool address  
üìù Todo : This problem can be solved with a simple update where command line arguments of bash script are used to configure xmrig parameters like pool coin address etc.   

ü§ù I'll fix these issues as soon as possible.
